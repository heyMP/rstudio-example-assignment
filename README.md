# Activity: Graph Replication

## Activity

Reproduce plots for Problem 5.3 & Problem 5.4 in the Data Computing Text.

Each plot must be reproduced using the `ggplot2` syntax.  In order to accomplish this task, you should run the `mplot()` command in the R console in order to access an interactive graph builder tool.  Modify the graph builder tool until you are satisfied, and then capture the `ggplot2` syntax.

**IMPORTANT:** There is starter code available in the file "GraphReplication.Rmd"... the graphs you are to replicate appear as ".png" files, but your task is to produce `ggplot2` R code that produces the identical graph directly (not a reference to a static image file). 

*Note: you can either use the interactive graphics commands from the `DataComputing` package or a similar function called `mplot()` from the`mosaic` package.*
